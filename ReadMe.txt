We might be beginning to get there, but we need to stabilise on the following:
commit whole directory tree, or just the code - not obj directories etc
scale of change between commits - longer gaps increase the merge conflicts
editor tab setting - I prefer 4 

More significantly, some agreement on what we're trying to write, and 
how to write it.
